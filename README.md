# CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle

Sprint Review and Retrospective & Agile Presentation:
These files highlights my understanding and application of Agile and Scrum practices.

Communication and active engagement with end users and stakeholders were crucial for interpreting user needs and implementing them into the SNHU Travel booking program.  By doing this, I was able to gather detailed information and understanding of feature requirements.  From the information gathered, I was able to piece together user stories to help articulate the stakeholders needs into a structured format.  User stories provided a clear description of required functionality and the purpose of the required feature.  This ensured that development efforts aligned with stakeholder expectations.  

As I approach development of programs, my process consists of iterative development, continuous feedback and adaptive planning.  Agile processes that I plan incorporate into my future work include Scrum Framework: Utilizing iterative Sprints to plan, develop and review my work. This should ensure continuous improvement as well as adaptability.  

A good team member in software development contributes to team goals, supports colleagues, and upholds principles of accountability, adaptability, empathy and respect.  This includes open communication and reliability while delivering quality work and creating an open environment where different ideas and perspectives are valued.
